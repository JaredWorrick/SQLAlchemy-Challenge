# SQLAlchemy-Challenge
Module 10 Challenge with SQLAlchemy


You've decided to treat yourself to a long holiday vacation in Honolulu, Hawaii. To help with your trip planning, you decide to do a climate analysis about the area. 


The following sections outline the steps that you need to take to accomplish this task.


Part 1: Analyze and Explore the Climate Data
  -> Used Python and SQLAlchemy to do a basic climate analysis and data exploration of the climate database. Specifically, used SQLAlchemy ORM queries,     Pandas, and Matplotlib. 
    - Precipitation Analysis
    - Station Analysis
 
 Part 2: Design Your Climate App
  -> Design a Flask API based on the queries that you just developed. To do so, use Flask to create your routes.
